        <p>Eleutheromania, an intense and irresistible desire for freedom. Its late night on Sunday now, end of weekends, most of which I spent on coding competitions on Hackerearth making it to 17<sup>th</sup> position in the first one and 5<sup>th</sup> position in second one. I missed 1st position in the first one by 0.5 points and a chance to win an I-Pad due to my lazines. Lesson learnt. Never back down.</p><p>But this post is not about the weekend, its about this week that started with me leaving home, dear home, on Sunday morning at 1:30 AM and landing in Coimbature and enroute to Palakkad, back again at the rented house, preparing for full fledge work from Monday. I have never in my whole life missed home or my city so much. It kind of felt unlike me for a moment. Now back to present scenario. Since we bought table and chairs at the rented place it now seems a little bit more livable. It feeds my fuel to stay awake at night, and also helps me stay in touch with my hobby of drawing, whenever I feel like it. After you have spent 3-4 months sitting on mattresses to do stuff, you really begin to value the comfort of something as basic as table and chairs.</p><p>This week I have probably seen and reseen more awesome stuff than few other weeks. I have watched some amazing movies like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1979320/">Rush</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1091191/">Lone Survivor</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637725/">Ted</a>. I wonder why Rush didn't win any awards, it was the best movie of 2013 if you ask me. I came across some good stuff on drawing &amp; algorithms, been going through it all week. But the best part was watching <a href="http://www.facebookstories.com/10">Facebook Stories</a>. Things like this make me wonder how technology is changing lives out there, how amazing experiences are being had by people, life changing experiences in some cases, through facebook. After watching this you might realize that you have underestimated the goodness of Internet &amp; Facebook. Another thing that had my attention this week was "Flappy Bird", its incredibly simple yet unbelievably addictive mobile game. My highscore is 61. The game is kind of an enjoyable frustration.</p><p>Now to the part where I conclude the title, Eleutheromania. This week I realized that no matter how many mistakes I made, how many exams I failed, or how many wrong turns I took, I always ended up in situations that were in some way or other better than what I had pictured them. I also have observed it in other people's lives, the same thing; the less you worry, the more you live. This feeling provokes me to make more mistakes, let go of everything for atleast an year and do whatever I feel like, and see how I survive the year and its aftermath. I am not sure if I am brave enough to do it, but lets see what happens, you never know. And as of now I have a new goal. "To leave a mark on the sands of time rather than being just another breath on the mirror, disappered and forgotten."</p><blockquote>Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact, and that is - everything around you that you call life, was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. That’s maybe the most important thing. It’s to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you’re just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it.   <sub>- Steve Jobs</sub></blockquote>
