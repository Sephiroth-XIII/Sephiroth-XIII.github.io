Took the friday off, caught a train early morning, our early morning – 10:00 am from Paddington to Bath Spa. This time Aishwarya planned everything so I was just there without any plans along for the ride. It was a nice, relaxing, planning-free vacation for me.</p><p>We reached Bath at 12:30, just 2.5 hours away from London, definitely making it a strong day-trip contender for one of our day offs. The train route is pretty scenic like all national rail journeys from London. Fields filled with sheeps and horses on the way, tracks sidelined with wild-flowers and sprinkles of small towns in between. This time we pre-booked the train seats as well, so both of us had window-seats for the whole journey. We were greeted with a beautiful city arranged neatly on an upwards slope as we got down from the train. We went to brunch right after that to Cosy Club, a nice cozy restaurant a short walk away from the station. A couple of cocktails, a sandwich and a burger later we were on with the first part of the trip – Prior Park Landscape Garden.</p><p>We just had our backpacks with us so we decided to carry them with us and walk to Prior Park. We met an old lady on our way there that warned us of the uphill climb, and she was spot-on. But we forgot about the climb once we reached there. The park was at the peak of Autumn, with a pond in the centre, the Palladian Bridge on the pond and a really old beautiful College building on one side of the park. The header image of this post is that of Palladian Bridge and the College building behind it. There are also a bunch of small cottages and tiny stone structures throughout the trek. But the highlight of the trek were 2 ducks that followed us and rubbed against us as if they were cats. They even followed us once we crossed the path and headed towards the bridge, they swam for a bit and climbed the steep hill to reach us. It was funny and adorable, and made us miss our cat Holly, who stayed back in London.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/content/images/2024/10/IMG_4436.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Bath" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG_4436.jpg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG_4436.jpg 1000w, /content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/IMG_4436.jpg 1600w, /content/images/size/w2400/2024/10/IMG_4436.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>After completing the main circular trek around the bridge, we headed to the in-park cafe to get a cup of coffee. Saw a little robin perched on the fence around the cafe. Then we headed towards the exit the one towards the Bath Skyline. Since it was getting a bit dark we headed straight to the bus station using a shortcut which was a muddy road surrounded by trees and streams, felt like a short adventure.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2024/10/IMG_4476.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" alt="Bath" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG_4476.jpg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG_4476.jpg 1000w, /content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/IMG_4476.jpg 1600w, /content/images/size/w2400/2024/10/IMG_4476.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2024/10/IMG_4477.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" alt="Bath" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG_4477.jpg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG_4477.jpg 1000w, /content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/IMG_4477.jpg 1600w, /content/images/size/w2400/2024/10/IMG_4477.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2024/10/IMG_4478.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" alt="Bath" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG_4478.jpg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG_4478.jpg 1000w, /content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/IMG_4478.jpg 1600w, /content/images/size/w2400/2024/10/IMG_4478.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2024/10/IMG_4479.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" alt="Bath" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG_4479.jpg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG_4479.jpg 1000w, /content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/IMG_4479.jpg 1600w, /content/images/size/w2400/2024/10/IMG_4479.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2024/10/IMG_4481.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" alt="Bath" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG_4481.jpg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG_4481.jpg 1000w, /content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/IMG_4481.jpg 1600w, /content/images/size/w2400/2024/10/IMG_4481.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption>A picture from trek in Prior Park, the shortcut muddy path that was a short adventure, the building Aishwarya was trying to sketch, a picture of the Abbey on our way to AirBnb &amp; the view from our AirBnB 😊</figcaption></figure><p>Aishwarya sketched the house with the Ralph Allen Drive sign on it while we waited for the bus to city centre. We bought a couple of supplies - milk for tea, some sweets and a map of the city once we reached the city centre. Then we headed to our AirBnB, another uphill walk, which was totally worth it, cause we were staying in this victorian house on the third floor that looked over the city. Aishwarya made tea, we sipped it watching our first sunset in Bath from the three windows that allowed us to take it all in, rested for a while and then off to dinner at Pintxo de Bath, a good Spanish place where we had some good wine, cheese, patatas bravas, crab croquettes, and chicken wings. We walked to our AirBnb much relaxed, and ready to call it a day. To my surprise we were able to get back without using a map.</p><p>After a good nights sleep (although the Victorian house was creaking throughout the night), we were off to an early start. We had Roman Baths and Abbey planned for the morning. First we had breakfast at The Green Bird Cafe and then we were off to the Roman Baths. The statues of the Roman Emperors surrounding the Baths with the Abbey in the background make for a very paintable view. The hot waters of the bath take up a warm teal colour reflecting the architecture around it, making it look all too beautiful. The stories of the roman everyday lives around the baths on the audio-guide made me feel that the Romans had a lot of right ideas about a lot of things – the social clubs, the order of the hot and cold baths and the massages, exercises and games thereafter. I pictured myself as a Roman citizen on a  Sunday taking a bath and relaxing there before heading to a nearby Colloseum to bet on the ongoing games. Back to the trip - In the museum there were coins and curses excavated from a nearby ruins of a temple, and lots of artefacts and stories of the might of the Roman Empire. After the Baths we went to the Abbey, which was a short tour. Once you have seen a couple of Abbeys they all just blend together. The more interesting part of the Abbey were the plaques on the wall mentioning people who lived and died in the 1700s &amp; 1800s – some of them lived way into their 70s, and some even touched their 80s. I am glad a lot more people today get to spend that amount of time on earth, and not just a top few. The illustrations around the history of the Abbey in the basement museum were quite amazing. We learned of more reasons to hate Henry VIII, and found some fascinating details about the lives of monks who served in the Abbey. </p><p>After the morning tour of the Roman Baths and the Abbey, we explored the city centre a little more to see what were our options for lunch. We picked a random restaurant and had a sandwich and a coffee there after which we began the secound part of the plan – Pulteney Bridge &amp; the Royal Cresent.</p><p>We walked straight towards Pulteney Bridge post lunch. The V shaped weir pointing towards the Birdge, and the Gold trees on the opposite side makes the whole view quite scenic. I was so glad we chose to come to Bath in Autumn, the trees do really look amazing – which compelled us to cross the bridge and go for the river walk that took us from beneath those trees along the river Avon. After our walk we went to Bath Stamp &amp; Coin Shop on the Pulteney Bridge. They had a great collection of stamps and mosaic tiles. I used to collect stamps when I was a teenager, so I enjoyed browsing their collection and remembering the simpler times. We grabbed a pouch of mosaic tiles as sovienier for us, and moved on.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2024/10/IMG_4572.jpeg" width="2000" height="2667" alt="Bath" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG_4572.jpeg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG_4572.jpeg 1000w, /content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/IMG_4572.jpeg 1600w, /content/images/size/w2400/2024/10/IMG_4572.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2024/10/IMG_4586.jpeg" width="2000" height="1500" alt="Bath" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG_4586.jpeg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG_4586.jpeg 1000w, /content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/IMG_4586.jpeg 1600w, /content/images/size/w2400/2024/10/IMG_4586.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2024/10/IMG_4583.jpeg" width="2000" height="2667" alt="Bath" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG_4583.jpeg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG_4583.jpeg 1000w, /content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/IMG_4583.jpeg 1600w, /content/images/size/w2400/2024/10/IMG_4583.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption>The weir, a picture from the walk along river Avon, the golden trees</figcaption></figure><p>After that we headed to the Royal Cresent. Octoberfest events were in full swing and we saw a bunch of people dressed up for it to the way there. Royal Cresent turned out to be a chill spot to relax for a while, sitting in the garden, at the focal point of the cresent taking in the view. From there we walked back to our AirBnB, relaxed a little and then headed to dinner. We headed to Sanremo - The Italian Restaurant. The food and wine were DIVINE, the staff was super friendly. It was the best Carbonara I have ever had, and the Amalfi Sundae with a Limoncello shot was the cherry on the top. Couldn't have ended our trip on a better note! We planned to go there for lunch the next day, but then in the morning we instead opted for a light breakfast at a nearby cafe before heading to Mr B's Emporium Bookshop to spend the remaining time exploring books before catching the train back to Paddington, London to be reunited with our apartment and Holly.</p><blockquote>I recall joking to Aishwarya a few times on the trip that we should take a couple of months off and stay here. While leaving our AirBnB the lock on our door got jammed and it felt as if the old house &amp; the city wished us to stay with them a bit longer.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A decade of Vans]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I was going through my old photos today.

We used to have vines of night-flowering jasmines, a couple of yellow elder trees, and a few other flowering plants whose flowers were reserved for garlands that my grandparents used to sow to be used during prayers. They were meant to be put around photos and statues of our Gods &amp; Goddesses. And of course, like every other Indian household, we had a  Holy Basil plant. My grandfather used to collect flowers from those plants in the morning, and when it was very cold outside, the task was handed to either my Dad or me. The jasmines used to shed fragrant flowers in our backyard, and the yellow elder trees that grew around our house produced flowers that had sweet nectar in them, which you could suck out from the stalks of the flowers. I remember enjoying drinking nectar from them along with my cousins and friends. Such low effort delights!</p><p>I don't remember taking an active interest in gardening in my teen years or in my 20s. When I was a teenager, one of my friends came up with a theory that if we crush some medicinal tablets, dissolve them in water to water flowering plants, we could change the colour of flowers. We tried it on a few plants without success. Now that I have been looking into gardening, I gather it might have been a way to change the pH of the soil to change flower colours, similar to how Hydrangeas change colours according to the acidity of soil—alkaline soil yields pink flowers and acidic soil yields blue flowers.</p><p>Since Aishwarya and I moved to London and rented a house that has a small private area that I could garden in, I have been taking an active interest in gardening. Growing fragrant flowering plants has become my hobby since last May. I started with taking care of a Yucca plant that was left by the previous tenant of the flat, learned about pruning dead leaves, and restored it to its full health. After that, I weeded the garden, as the weeds were  home to quite a lot of snails that were eating the leaves of the yucca plant and a few other plants that Aishwarya had planted. I left a patch of wall lettuce for them to feed on and set a trap. They would rush to eat the wall lettuce once the sun went down and fell in the trap; next morning, I would dispose of them. Got rid of them half-way through this method and then just sprinkled nematodes to get rid of the rest of them. Garden cleared and ready for new life!</p><p>Next we had to decide what plants we should grow in our garden. On our evening walks every time we saw any plants or flowers we liked, we used to identify them via the PictureThis app and prepare a list of plants for our garden. I love fragrant flowers that are blue or violet in colour, and none more so than Lavender. That was the first plant I bought, along with some Campanulas and Osteospermums. We also got a bunch of seeds from our trip to Kew gardens. Kew gardens is the Disneyland of green-thumbed people. Aishwarya bought seeds for vegetables and herbs, and I bought seeds for flowers that had blue or violet flowers. I killed the Lavender plant by overwatering it and bunch of Lavender seedlings by transplanting them too soon; nevertheless, I learned a lot about how to care for plants and how to grow them from seeds along the way. I have successfully maintained 5 Lavender saplings that germinated last June. Very proud of myself for this one, since I was told that Lavenders are tough to grow from seeds. This year I got a Queen Elizabeth rose, a star jasmine plant, and started new batches of Osteospermums and Lobelias. Can't wait to see my garden in full bloom next summer! :)</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2023/05/IMG_2354.jpg" width="975" height="731" alt="My Garden" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2023/05/IMG_2354.jpg 600w, /content/images/2023/05/IMG_2354.jpg 975w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2023/05/IMG_2348.jpg" width="650" height="412" alt="My Garden" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2023/05/IMG_2348.jpg 600w, /content/images/2023/05/IMG_2348.jpg 650w"></div></div></div><figcaption>Yellow and violet Osteospermums on the left.

Lots of updates. Major update - we moved to London in January 2022 with our cat Holly. I moved to a research team in Google as a bungee (a program which allows us to work 100% of the time with a different team for 6 months), ended up switching to the team full-time since I loved the team and the work I was doing. I got offered a choice between moving to London or SF. Since both my wife Aishwarya &amp; I wanted to travel Europe, and it was easier for her to obtain a work permit in the UK than in the US, we decided to move to London. Aishwarya's work-place was also happy to extend her a UK contract, so it was really an easy choice.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2023/04/holly.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="London" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/holly.jpeg 600w, /content/images/2023/04/holly.jpeg 907w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Holly basking in the sunlight on a rare sunny day in London!</figcaption></figure><p>When we first arrived in London, we stayed at Zinc House in Farringdon. This residence was provided by Google for the first 2 months, and they were kind enough to extend our stay by an additional month since the house we wanted to rent wasn't available till the start of April. We enjoyed our 3 months there - it was within walking distance of St. Paul's Cathedral and other tourist attractions, surrounded by good restaurants, and just a stone's throw away from the Farringdon Underground Station. Unfortunately, we got COVID in our first week here, and we were in quarantine until the first week of February. We were a bit terrified but thanks to the staff at Zinc House, who bought us our medicines, and my team-mates who answered every query I had regarding UK's healthcare system, we had an easy and almost a stress-free recovery. Post quarantine, we were all set to explore London. Neither of us had been to London or any other parts of the UK before, and we had fun discovering new things for the first time. The past year has been quite an adventure! After a little more than an year in London, we feel like we have settled in quite nicely. Made a few friends, travelled more than we did before (we are couch-potatoes to our very core), saw some plays and musicals, took an art-class, visited a bunch of museums, enjoyed London's Christmas &amp; New Year celebrations, and have a place we like to call home.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2023/04/a.jpg" width="810" height="1080" alt="London" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/a.jpg 600w, /content/images/2023/04/a.jpg 810w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2023/04/b.jpg" width="907" height="1210" alt="London" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/b.jpg 600w, /content/images/2023/04/b.jpg 907w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2023/04/c.jpg" width="907" height="1210" alt="London" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/c.jpg 600w, /content/images/2023/04/c.jpg 907w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2023/04/d.jpg" width="907" height="1210" alt="London" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/d.jpg 600w, /content/images/2023/04/d.jpg 907w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2023/04/e.jpg" width="907" height="1210" alt="London" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/e.jpg 600w, /content/images/2023/04/e.jpg 907w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2023/04/f.jpg" width="1210" height="907" alt="London" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/f.jpg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2023/04/f.jpg 1000w, /content/images/2023/04/f.jpg 1210w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2023/04/g.jpg" width="1210" height="907" alt="London" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/g.jpg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2023/04/g.jpg 1000w, /content/images/2023/04/g.jpg 1210w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2023/04/h.jpg" width="907" height="1210" alt="London" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/h.jpg 600w, /content/images/2023/04/h.jpg 907w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption>Iconic Red Telephone Box, Lady Justice on top of Old Bailey (V for Vendetta fans), 3 photos from our walks around our temporary residence, Angel Street on Christmas, Palace of Westminster &amp; Big Ben, Dean Village in Edinburgh.</figcaption></figure><p>I have also discovered that this city provides a good environment for all my hobbies. I like building stuff, sketching, painting, baking and I recently got into gardening. On all counts London hasn't disappointed a bit. There is an endless supply of model kits available through Amazon &amp; local hobby shops nearby. I completed building 2 model-kit airplanes and am in the process of building a 3rd one. I have bought an easel and some art supplies that allow me from time to time to sketch from observation. I also joined an art-class in the Google London office that has allowed me to experiment with various media, improving my work under the guidance of the teacher and other members in the group. I have made some paintings with oil pastels that I am pretty happy with. Aishwarya &amp; I also went to an art-class once, where we learned the basics of drawing; that was a fun experience as well. As for baking, the variety of materials available in the stores here—types of sugars, flours &amp; ingredients—are endless, and with these supplies comes the freedom to experiment. I have managed to perfect some recipes and I maintain a notebook these days to write down my variations and methods. Most recently, I managed to bake a 4-layered chocolate cake that was IMHO better than any other cakes we have had in London—I still can't beat the cakes that were available in Hyderabad's Old Madras Baking Company or Theobroma. I have also managed to grow lavender plants from seeds; it took over 10 months for them to grow over 5cm. They are a good lesson in patience and perseverance. I have also managed to keep Campanula, Queen Elizabeth Roses &amp; Star Jasmine alive for a while now. I also managed to kill a few saplings and a full-grown lavender plant earlier last year. I like to label this under learning by failing. Two important lessons learned - Never overwater plants, and what overwatering actually means.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2023/04/i.jpg" width="1080" height="791" alt="London" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/i.jpg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2023/04/i.jpg 1000w, /content/images/2023/04/i.jpg 1080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2023/04/j.jpg" width="1210" height="907" alt="London" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/j.jpg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2023/04/j.jpg 1000w, /content/images/2023/04/j.jpg 1210w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2023/04/k.jpg" width="1210" height="907" alt="London" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/k.jpg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2023/04/k.jpg 1000w, /content/images/2023/04/k.jpg 1210w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2023/04/l.jpg" width="1097" height="793" alt="London" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/l.jpg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2023/04/l.jpg 1000w, /content/images/2023/04/l.jpg 1097w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2023/04/m.jpg" width="1210" height="907" alt="London" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/m.jpg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2023/04/m.jpg 1000w, /content/images/2023/04/m.jpg 1210w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption>Heinkel He 70 1:72 model, Hokkaido milk bread, Caramel custard, Fruit arrangement painted with Oil Pastels, Vought F4U Corsair 1:72 model painted to look like the Corsairs from the movie Devotion.</figcaption></figure><p>We also managed to visit a few places since we got here. We went to Edinburgh, Scotland last year for 4-5 days. That was the first trip I planned from start to end all by myself, including lunches and dinners for every single day we were there. It was the most perfect trip. I'll try to add a backdated post about that someday soon. We went to India in December to attend my cousin Nidhi's wedding. We met a lot of our relatives, played cards to our heart's content and had the best time. I got to meet my nephew for the first time, saw all my cousins, uncles and aunts from Maharashtra after a long time, had lots of get-togethers, lunches and dinners. It was just the best. Then we came back to London for Christmas and visited a few Christmas Markets and enjoyed the decorations and lights on various streets. This year in March, we visited Rome for a week. This was a loosely planned trip, but we had fun, and a rollercoaster staycation. It was relaxing because we were staying in a nice AirBnB in the city centre, but a little stressful as Aishu sprained her ankle on the way there and she had to spend 3 days resting. This month, Aishu's cousins visited us. We all went to the London Eye, took Thames Cruise, visited Dover Castle &amp;  White Cliffs of Dover. We also visited her relatives in Birmingham, which is calmer and more relaxing than London. Had a proper family gathering there—an extravagant lunch, followed by a short nap, and surrounded by pleasant chit-chat through out the day. Such gatherings were very frequent when we were in India; here they are quite rare but still bring home closer. These days I am miss home more and more, and I am torn between staying in London and moving back to Vadodara, but moments like these bring me peace for a few moments. London is wonderful and serves all our hobbies and wanderlust, and at times it does feel like home but still doesn't fill in for Vadodara. Although Vadodara has a lot less stuff to do in an around the city compared to London, I can't help but miss it.</p><p>Work-wise, it's been a tough start this year. With layoffs in Google and rest of the tech Industry, my mind has been screaming "Go back to being an Indie" more and more. Over the last 6 years, I have worked on a lot of exciting things at Google but nothing compares to delivering products directly to users and iterating on their feedback, feels more personal and fulfilling rather than the small cog in the big machine feeling. I thought I could have had that in the current team, but dealing with health related products at Google has been a whole different beast. Despite this, I have had a lot of fun working on my current team. I had a unique opportunity to design &amp; develop an app by collaborating with clinicians, research-scientists, UX designers and researchers - learned a lot more about how to make an app accessible. Learned a whole lot about building and polishing a product through the lens of a big organization, co-authored a <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v174/roy22a.html">paper</a>, received a lot of emails that addressed me as Professor Chintan Ghate &amp; some as Dr. Chintan Ghate, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I was also stressed through the roof for some parts of this year while working on this project, but I guess that is to be expected. This between switching countries and dealing with a shit-ton of paperwork, I don't think I have ever pushed myself this much ever before.</p><p>I think this has been an adequate recap of the last two years of my life. Time has been good to me, but I think I have been harsher on myself than necessary at times, and have made life difficult for myself when it need not be so. However, writing this post has made me feel better, and I hope to write more often in the future.</p><blockquote><em>The proper function of man is to live, not to exist.

We had a quick and  simple ceremony in my hometown, Vadodara, amidst a global pandemic. It was one of the happiest moments of my life. We returned to Hyderabad a couple of weeks after that, and have been enjoying our life here.</p><p>All things considered, 2020 has been quite a turbulent year. Starting March 2020, India went into a full lockdown; so did the Google Office in Hyderabad. Since then, I’ve been working from home. I thought I would thrive in the WFH environment, but being locked up at home 24/7 has not agreed with me. My internal clock has been out of whack at least for the past 7 months. I have been sleeping in the afternoon, waking up at 10 in the night, having dinner after midnight, and working till early mornings, sometimes with an offset of quite a few hours. I have missed quite a few work meetings due to this (Oops!). </p><p>However, a pretty cool thing happened during WFH. I had a chance to set-up a workspace for Aishwarya &amp; I. We have been gradually improving it by adding desk toys and indoor plants over the past 3-4 months, which has been quite fun. The best part about this - Google chipped in one grand for WFH accessories to build our workspace, which I think was well invested. We assembled the IKEA desk  and the shelf (one on the right side in the picture) ourselves, which was an amazing experience. God, we love IKEA!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/content/images/2021/03/PXL_20201228_062614434.MP.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Married Life" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/PXL_20201228_062614434.MP.jpg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/PXL_20201228_062614434.MP.jpg 1000w, /content/images/size/w1600/2021/03/PXL_20201228_062614434.MP.jpg 1600w, /content/images/size/w2400/2021/03/PXL_20201228_062614434.MP.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>During the pandemic, I tried my hand at a lot of hobbies - penmanship, ink painting, 3D art in Blender, and also some important life skills like cooking. I am kinda proud to say that I have developed enough cooking skills to have a signature dish - Turkish Eggs. I also learned some complex vegetarian recipes, which I am still perfecting. I have been cooking with Head Chef (Aishwarya's well-deserved nickname) during lunches and working towards further improving my skills, which is always a delight.</p><p>Moving on to other exciting developments, we have domesticated a stray cat, named Holly, who comes every single day for food and pets, and has made our lock-down a little more pleasant. The funny thing is Aishu likes her way more than I do and pampers her a lot , but when it comes to sitting in our laps, Holly prefers mine. It makes Aishu a little envious, and it's really fun to tease her about it.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2021/03/PXL_20210125_190933659.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Married Life" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/PXL_20210125_190933659.jpg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/PXL_20210125_190933659.jpg 1000w, /content/images/size/w1600/2021/03/PXL_20210125_190933659.jpg 1600w, /content/images/size/w2400/2021/03/PXL_20210125_190933659.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Holly sleeping besides me :)</figcaption></figure><p>I think this is the best photo of Holly I have. We have grown very fond of her. Every morning, as soon as she hears our room door open, she comes to our window and starts meowing. She's a very clever and observant cat.</p><p>I learned a lot at work as well during 2020. It seemed like I had an infinite time to go over things during last year; it provided me with enough clarity regarding what I was missing from my work, &amp; the changes I needed to make. I  made some bets accordingly, and will be working on them over upcoming months. So a good amount of change at work as well! The last 5 months have been tough as hell, mostly due to being cooped-up at home (thanks to the pandemic), and the almost constant stream of bad news that the pandemic brought along. All of that made me feel quite helpless at times. Anyhow, here's hoping for change! :)</p><p>Our team also sent out a lot of swags during the year-end 2020. One of the swags was a projector, and we have been enjoying watching Ghibli movies on it. I am completely in love with Studio Ghibli’s Art direction. I am trying to adapt their style in my 3D models in Blender while making short animations, and I am enjoying the process very much.</p><p>That's all for today. See you next time, and hoping to write again, soon.</p><blockquote>Adventure is out there!</blockquote>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Turbulently Peaceful]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>So much has happened since we last talked.

I completed 2 years at Google on May 22, got promoted on October 23, &amp; <strong>got engaged</strong> on October 26. These past 6 months have definitely been the best time of my life yet.</p><p>I am sitting at my desk in my room in Hyderabad, it's 1:05 am, I have been looking at my Photos albums for the past half an hour, reminiscing. Thought it would be unfair to not put these memories in my blog. Let's begin from where we left off in the last post.</p><p>After I came back from the NY-SF trip in April, I took a short vacation in May and went home to attend my cousin's wedding. This time I invited Aishwarya with me to introduce her to the extended family, oh yes &amp; we went to Ravi's wedding together as well in December (Ravi is one of my oldest friends; we were neighbours since childhood.), where I introduced her to my friends. It was fun.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2021/03/MVIMG_20190521_122420-2.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Turbulently Peaceful" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/MVIMG_20190521_122420-2.jpeg 600w, /content/images/2021/03/MVIMG_20190521_122420-2.jpeg 810w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>I love this picture we took at my cousin's wedding.</figcaption></figure><p>After the little vacation, I came back to Hyderabad &amp; got back to work. Around the end of May Aishwarya got the news that she has been accepted in Syngene, Hyderabad. She would be moving here, in the same city as me, by August. This was the best news so far. We have been in a long distance relationship since last 1.5 years, nothing could be better than her moving here, and us being together at least every weekend. Meanwhile, I was getting involved in new projects, working with new teams, the work was getting better but at the same time a little hectic sometimes due to all the new variables. So I took up sketching for a while to blow off some steam after work.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2021/03/IMG_20190627_032322.jpeg" width="1080" height="1040" alt="Turbulently Peaceful" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/IMG_20190627_032322.jpeg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/IMG_20190627_032322.jpeg 1000w, /content/images/2021/03/IMG_20190627_032322.jpeg 1080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2021/03/IMG_20190628_002352.jpeg" width="1080" height="1158" alt="Turbulently Peaceful" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/IMG_20190628_002352.jpeg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/IMG_20190628_002352.jpeg 1000w, /content/images/2021/03/IMG_20190628_002352.jpeg 1080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2021/03/IMG_20190629_014249.jpeg" width="1080" height="1107" alt="Turbulently Peaceful" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/IMG_20190629_014249.jpeg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/IMG_20190629_014249.jpeg 1000w, /content/images/2021/03/IMG_20190629_014249.jpeg 1080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/content/images/2021/03/IMG_20190701_042433.jpeg" width="1080" height="996" alt="Turbulently Peaceful" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/IMG_20190701_042433.jpeg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/IMG_20190701_042433.jpeg 1000w, /content/images/2021/03/IMG_20190701_042433.jpeg 1080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption>I am really pleased with the last one :)</figcaption></figure><p>By the end of June I got to know that I would have to visit US for 2 weeks from July 16 to 8th August. So before I left for US, I went home for a weekend to relax. I reached home on the morning of 12th July. Aishu took me to a very fancy and cheesy dinner that night, I enjoyed it way more than I expected. People say that we are cheesy, but this dinner was a whole new level. Apparently there was some miscommunication about the dinner decorations &amp; we ended up at a table that was decorated with red-colored heart-shaped balloons and candles. It was unexpected for the both of us, neither of us have the taste that the table represented, but we had a good laugh about it, got comfortable with all that red &amp; had an amazing dinner.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2021/03/IMG_20190712_200320.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Turbulently Peaceful" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/IMG_20190712_200320.jpeg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/IMG_20190712_200320.jpeg 1000w, /content/images/2021/03/IMG_20190712_200320.jpeg 1080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The dinner table 😄</figcaption></figure><p>After that, the next day me &amp; my parents visited her home. The planning for our engagement has been happening for a few months by then, so we decided to fix a date that day and have a rough plan ready for the event. We decided to do it in Diwali, sometime in October. After that splendid weekend I came back to Hyderabad &amp; started preparing for the US trip &amp; at the same time was busy with the daily work &amp; preparing my self-assessment for the upcoming performance review. I was applying for a promotion this time, so it was extra stressful. The US trip this time seemed too long. I was there for 2 weeks, eating unhealthy food, drinking Guinness at an Irish Bar near the Hotel where I was staying, tinkering away at the Vision Kit, Audio Kit &amp; GameShell that I ordered online &amp; received within a few days of getting there. I drank Guinness for the first time in my life &amp; also got involved in electronics and raspberry-pi for the first time. I had a lot of fun assembling and playing around with the gameshell kit in my hotel room after work. The work also went well, so over all the trip was a success.</p><p>After I got back to Hyderabad on 9th August, Aishwarya moved to Hyderabad the very next day. Her parents came to drop her off. We visited a few local restaurants while they were here. The funny thing is whenever her parents and we go out for a meal to a place I recommend, it never works as well as I imagine. We go to this south-indian place I like, the service that day is way worse than usual. The next day we go to this Punjabi place I love, they are out of paneer – A PUNJABI RESTAURANT OUT OF FREAKING PANEER. It isn't a disaster, but it's disappointing. I have already started making a list of new places for their next visit that would hopefully live upto my expectations.</p><p>Aishwarya and I spend August &amp; September roaming around the city on weekends, meeting each of our few relatives that stay in the city, shopping clothes for our engagement. The weekends go by so fast that it is 23 October before we know it. We had a morning flight to Vadodara that day, the promotion news did drop in 5 minutes before we left for the airport. I took some sweets home from airport to celebrate the news. The next 2 days went in a blur, in the engagement preparations. I spent some quality time with my parents on this vacation, we chatted a lot &amp; saw a whole movie together after so many years. The day of engagement, all my close relatives came over to my place &amp; we had a pleasant time. The engagement event started – I had stage fright when we went up to the stage for the main event &amp; had cheek-aches due to the constant smiling for the constant photographs with the guests. It was fun but tiring. Neither she nor I are fan of any kind of ceremonies. The next day all my cousins were staying at my place, Aishwarya also joined us, we all had a nice night-out watching horror movies, playing cards &amp; eating Maggi noodles at midnight. It was so much fun. I don't remember having a night-out like that in quite a while. On 30th we came back to Hyderabad.</p><blockquote>And although this time we were engaged &amp; wearing rings, we were pleasantly surprised by how a lot has changed and yet nothing has changed at all.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Big Apple]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>It's mid March, the Global EngProd Summit for 2019 at Google is scheduled to be hosted in San Francisco on 22nd &amp; 23rd April.

I apply for a spot in the summit as soon as the Registration link opens &amp; recieve a confirmation for it within a week. I was planning to leave a bit early and spend the weekend in San Francisco to avoid being jet-lagged on event-days. Just to make sure that there are no prior engagements I check my calendar, &amp; to my surprise I discover we have a holiday on Friday, its Good Friday. So now I have a long weekend that I can utilize better. I call my cousin, Trushna, who stays in New Jersey &amp; ask her if she's free during the weekend, &amp; she is. And so the plan for the New York trip hatches.</p><p>I ask my manager if it's okay to book my flights to SF via New York, &amp; he gives me a green light. I book flights the very same evening. This was the first time I had Business Class seats on an International flight. I had a great time watching movies on the huge screen, relaxing in those spacious seats, and visiting the in-flight lounge. And after that better than usual flight, I reached New York airport, where Trushna was waiting to pick me up. We have tea at the airport, &amp; we head to her home. First subway, then a bus ride and finally we reach her home. The street on which she lives has cherry-blossom like trees on both side, amazing murals on the walls, all together a pretty cool place. I get a few hours of sleep before beginning our New York trip.</p><p>It's 19th April, evening, we begin our trip to NY. First stop, One World Trade Center &amp; World Trade Memorial. Next, we head to the Oculus and the Westfield WTC Mall, which feels like being inside a skeleton of a leviathan. We come up from the Oculus, see a parade kinda thing on the street. There are murals painted over fences, and food trucks everywhere. We grab a bite to eat and take a lot of photos in the colorful backgrounds. Next, we visit nearby places -- The bank that is robbed by Joker in the beginning of Dark Knight, The Trinity Church, The Red Cube, Federal Hall. Afterwards we go to the Brooklyn Bridge, walk half-way and back. Then we take a subway to Staten Island Ferry station. We take a trip back and forth on the Ferry, see Statue of Liberty from the Ferry, after that we decide to head home. We are done for the day.</p><p>The next day, 20th April, I have plans with my college buddies to go for Brunch and some sight seeing. Dhruvraj, Rahul, &amp; Jay come to pick me up around 10 in the morning near Trushna's place. We go to brunch at their usual place, after that we grab a cigar from a nearby shop and head to Liberty State park. It is foggy so we aren't able to see the skyline properly, but we enjoy the cigar in the cold weather, see the Central Railroad of NJ Terminal, the empty sky memorial and then head back to Truhna's place around 1pm. I rest till 3pm in the afternoon, then Trushna, Rikkin and me head to New York again to do the remaining touristy stuff. We have dollar Pizza slices first, they are delicious. We head to Central Park, see the famouns FRIENDS fountain, witness an impromptu opera near the fountain, see a guy making giant soap bubbles, see street-side artists sketching park-visitors, vendors selling fancy posters and decorative licencse plates, pinups from the 80s. It's all very amusing. Oh, and we also see the Cherry Blossoms bloom in their full glory. After that we head out, while heading out we see a line of horse buggies waiting for weary travellers. We see the General William Tecumseh Sherman Monument, &amp; head to have our evening snacks at  Halal Guys -- chicken &amp; Falafel. After that we head to the Chelsea Market. I get choclates, candies and cotton-candies from "The Nut Box". Chelsea Market is a nice place with lots of nice cafes and restaurants. Next, we head to take a tour of the NY Google office, &amp; it's totally worth it. They have a lego gallery, one of the best view of New York city from the balcony (although the door to the blacony was closed, we could get a good glance from behind the door). We play pool, TT, shoot some 3-pointers and compete in dance-dance revolution. After that we go to the Flatiron room -- it's a Jazz bar with great ambience. I have a Yamazaki there as it was recommended by my flatmate, Raunaq. After that we go to the famous Times Square. We see all the buzz &amp; lightning of Times Square, have waffle for dinner, take some good photos on the red stairwell. We are done for the day &amp; done with the New York tour as well. The next day I head back to the airport to catch my next flight to SF.</p><p>This time I choose to stay at Staybridge Sunnyvale, unlike at Courtyard Mariott where I stay every single time I come to SF on business-trips. That turns out to be a poor decision; Courtyard Marriott is surrounded by better restaurants, and views. After some rest, I go to the San Francisco office for a meeting, the view of the Bay Bridge from there is magnificent. Next 2 days are spent in the EngProd Summit, with lot of new things to learn. At the end of second day Google hosts a nice event for the summit visitors. I try my hands at archery, ring-toss, &amp; have good food, some beer &amp; splendid time with my colleagues. The next day I am on my flight back to Hyderabad, after a great time in New York &amp; a great Summit in SF.</p><blockquote>There is nothing quite like New York City at night.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Beautiful Bali]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>It all starts somewhere in mid-August.

I receive a mail saying that this year's offsite is going to be hosted in Bali. I remember the last time my friends and I planned for a Bali trip, a volcano managed to burn down our plans. I was pleased to check-off Bali from my list of South-East Asian countries. Since I joined Google, I have been to Malaysia &amp; Singapore, and now it was going to be Indonesia.</p><p>The offsite event is going to run from 28th November, Wednesday to 30th November, Friday. People are going to disband Friday afternoon, and it seemed like a good plan to stay back, hit some beaches, do a little surfing, or rather learn a little surfing during the weekend. Apparently I wasn't the only one thinking that, so a bunch of office buddies and I decided to extend the trip and stay back the weekend and roam around in Bali.</p><p>The trip starts on 28th November afternoon, when our flight lands in Bali. We off-board the flight, to find that drop-off has been arranged by the office, and there's a guy with GPay offsite board, standing near the exit of airport  waiting to pick us up and drop us off to the beautiful Grand Hyatt Hotel in Nusa Dua, where the office has arranged our stay for next 2 days. Yuvaraj and I were roomies during the Grand Hyatt stay, we reach our room to find out its a huge room with a deck outside. I take a shower and decide to head outside to the deck with a can of beer, to sit on a chair and enjoy the view. I finish the can of beer while admiring the view outside. There's a pond right outside our room with a sitting arrangement in the centre. It's very calm. Grand Hyatt guys know how to maintain the ambience, but God that place is confusing when you need to return back to your room from the reception lobby. We go and join our friends for lunch soon after, where I had wine with some Balinese speciality dish with chicken, rice and cabbage, tasted nice, but didn't smell so good. The wine helped. After the lunch I decided to have a look around that place. It's quite beautiful.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2021/03/20190104_231051-COLLAGE.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Beautiful Bali" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/20190104_231051-COLLAGE.jpeg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/20190104_231051-COLLAGE.jpeg 1000w, /content/images/2021/03/20190104_231051-COLLAGE.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Views in and around the Grand Hyatt, Nusa Dua, Bali</figcaption></figure><p>The top-right photo you see in the collage was the view right near the lobby. One look at that and I decided to go and have a look at the beach. I am very fond of beaches. The sand, the sound of the waves, watching the waves touch the sand beneath your feet and feel the pull of the water as the waves recede back into the ocean, it's always surreal. I sit at the beach for a while, and the phone buzzes 10 mins to dinner. Apparently the office decided to host drinks &amp; dinner for the first night we were there, at a nearby place. We head to the dinner. It's quite a nice place near the beach, The food and drinks were quite nice. I decided to stick with desserts and drinks. I had some drink, I cannot recall the name of, but was basically hot-chocolate mixed with brandy. I was having a cold and brandy has come in handy when I had a sinus infection earlier this year, so seemed rational. After having conversation with few people, having a bunch of desserts and 2 of those drinks, I think they were called Lumumba or something like that, I decided to take a stroll along the beach. There were quite a lot of cafe's and restaurant along the beach, some with live music. Also 3 docks which were quite a nice and quiet place to sit and listen to the waves. I sat there for quite a while without any disturbance, &amp; returned to the party after the stroll. The party was still in full swing, but after that quiet time, the party seemed quite noisy, so I decided to head back to the hotel room, in the first bus that was leaving the premises. After going back to the room and taking a nap, I heard noises of people singing Bollywood songs, recognized some voices, made some calls and joined them. We got drunk, and sang some songs. Good times. Went back to my room late at night, and dozed off, Wednesday, day 1 was over.</p><p>Thursday morning, I woke up with a major hangover an hour before the time the morning meeting was supposed to begin. Turns out I might have had more whiskey than I should have, the night before. I managed to take a bath, and get ready for the meeting and lunch in an hour. Went to the meeting, the meeting started, and I remember the speaker started going over the growth stats over the last year, basically a lot of back-patting for the team. I started feeling cold, so I came back to the room to get my sweatshirt. As soon as I reached the room, I had a sudden urge to lie down, and I slept again for the next 2 hours, till Yuvaraj came back and woke me up. Now it was time for the Google organised fun-activity. Now the fun activity that I chose for the offsite was water sports. When we gathered to board the bus that was supposed to take us to the beach where the activities for the afternoon were going to take place, a bunch of safety and other announcements were made, one of them was "If you are having a hangover, better stay back". I laughed it off and decided to join the activity anyway. As soon as the bus started moving, I realised I might have made a mistake, but luckily I didn't throw up, even once during the whole activity. A bunch of us went to the beach and had a swell time. We went glass boating and fed fishes, held snakes and turtles, and saw Iguana, Cockatoo, Bats and giant tortoises. After that we had banana boat ride, and donut boat ride, jet-skiing and ocean-walking. It was all a lot of fun. Especially jet skiing and ocean-walking,  jumping off of waves, &amp; being in the calm of the ocean among the fishes. A turbulently peaceful day. After that we went back to our rooms late that evening after the fun-activity. Took some rest and went to the gala dinner in traditional attires. My friends and I managed to get a good table, near the stage where the local performers were performing Balinese traditional dance and music. This time I had some food, but mostly dessert and juices, I decided to avoid drinks. The lime ice-cream and the mango-jelly dessert were amazing. There was a dance and DJ arrangements for the night too, but I was in no mood to participate that night, so went to bed early.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2021/03/IMG_20181129_194313.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Beautiful Bali" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/IMG_20181129_194313.jpeg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/IMG_20181129_194313.jpeg 1000w, /content/images/size/w1600/2021/03/IMG_20181129_194313.jpeg 1600w, /content/images/2021/03/IMG_20181129_194313.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Balinese Traditional Dance and Music</figcaption></figure><p>The next morning we woke up, had brunch and decided to checkout from the hotel, and head to the airbnb we booked.

It's a perfect place to watch the beautiful sunset, and have food and drinks with friends and family. They also have a pool bar, and a beach very close-by to enjoy the sunset from. After that we went to a bar and restaurant called La Favela. We had dinner and drinks there, danced a little and headed home.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2021/03/20190104_231442-COLLAGE.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Beautiful Bali" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/20190104_231442-COLLAGE.jpeg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/20190104_231442-COLLAGE.jpeg 1000w, /content/images/2021/03/20190104_231442-COLLAGE.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photos from Potato head &amp; La Favela</figcaption></figure><p>The next day we woke up late and after having lunch decided to go and visit some beaches. We went and learned how to surf. It was by far the activity I loved the most in Bali. To get on the surfing board, paddle your way into the ocean against the incoming waves, turn your surfboard around now facing the beach, wait for that wave to hit you, paddle some more to gain the momentum, manage to stand up and maintain your balance on the surfboard, &amp; ride that wave, repeat.  I managed to ride a couple of waves. It was amazing. That night we visited another beach nearby to our airbnb. To see the beauty and the horror of the ocean in the dark of the night is something else. The two days went by really fast and extremely pleasant. We returned back to Hyderabad the next day.</p><blockquote>The ocean stirs the heart, inspires the imagination and brings eternal joy to the soul.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A missed flight]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>It's 27th August, afternoon.

I was supposed to be back in Hyderabad today, back to work at the office, instead I am writing this from Aishwarya's room in Gandhinagar. I missed my flight yesterday.</p><p>I came home this time to celebrate Rakshabandhan, which was this Sunday on 26th. Took a much needed break from personal &amp; office work. Baked a cake with Aishwarya on Saturday. Then went on a date to this place called "The Secret Kitchen", the food was great, we had a fun time. I was so hungry by the time we got to the restaurant that I spent most of the time focused on eating. She pranced in the rain while we were waiting for the Uber ride back home, &amp; got cold the moment we got into the Uber, since the AC in the car was at a full blast. It was a fun evening.</p><p>I have been traveling in the rains quite a lot in the month of August. And in that time I have rather grown fond of doing that. The flight trips are fun due to the turbulence and the rants of people who are either first time flyers or are afraid of flying. I have been reading during flights &amp; on the airport while enjoying a hot cup of coffee. Its become a thing, to find a nice spot on every Airport I visit to find a good coffee shop with a good view to sit and read at.</p><p>The Uber rides in the rain are nice too. Especially during the night. It's quite a sight. You see the tail lights of the vehicles ahead of you leave a trail in the wet road, making it look like you are living in a long exposure shot. Even the reflecting road signs leave an elongated reflection on the wet roads making you feel like the time is stretching by. The trucks in the opposite lane generate a fine spray of water as they go, which is illuminated by their side lights &amp; their tail lights, and you are reminded of the scene from Rudyard Kipling novel, of the first time Mowgli sees the Elephants, the creators of the jungle, bustling along spraying water, and you the Mowgli in this jungle of concrete marveling at the trucks. Rains make trucks seem like whimsical creatures in the jungle of concrete, thats how awesome rains are.</p><p>So this Sunday was the first time in my life I had missed a flight. Aishwarya and I planned to leave home at 4:20pm, my flight was scheduled at 8:20pm, &amp; I was supposed to reach the airport with 2 hours to spare. But I made a major blunder not anticipating the unavailability of Uber considering it was a festive day. So we improvised and planned to catch a bus. We reached the bus stop, but there was a huge line there as well for buses to Ahmedabad. Somehow we managed to get an Uber, but even the Uber was quite late due to the traffic. We left Vadodara around 5:20. I was so very anxious. Thank god she was with me being the voice of reason, trying to calm me down. We entered the Ahmedabad city in time, but got stuck in a gruesome traffic on the way to the Airport. It was already 8:20 and we were still enroute, the gates close 25 mins prior to departure, and weirdly enough the flight was on time yesterday. And hence I missed my flight. Aishwarya's landlady was kind enough to allow me to stay at their place. I was feeling quite numb when I reached at her place. I was going to miss one more day of work, but I was also going to get to spend a few more hours with her. She cooked Maggie and potato wedges. Once we had dinner I felt quite relaxed and happy. This was supposed to be one of the worst day, this was the 3rd flight I had to cancel/miss in this month. I was supposed to be annoyed &amp; sad, but I wasn't. I was very happy that she was with me for the journey, I was able to stay with her for a few more hours before returning back to Hyderabad. Had she been not there, I would have probably broken down, cause it would have been a very depressing ride back home to Vadodara for another 2 hours.</p><p>She went to work today morning, I stayed in her room. Ordered some tea &amp; Gujarati breakfast over Swiggy. Completed reading Origin by Dan Brown. I was very happy to see that my prediction of the antagonist in the story was spot on. Dan Brown's antagonists become very predictable after you read the first 2 books, and see the clear pattern. Still quite a gripping story. Now that I have finished writing this post, I will be leaving quite early today, will take a book from Aishwarya's collection or from the airport to pass the time during tonight's flight.</p><blockquote>To the upsides of missing a flight!</blockquote>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Love]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>It's 26th May, 5:04 in the morning, I am sitting at my desk in my room in Hyderabad, writing this down at the end of a sleepless night.

It's quite quiet. It's been 2 days since I redesigned my blog, 4 days since I completed a year at Google, &amp; 6 days since I kissed her. God, I miss her!</p><p>It's been quite a while since I wrote something on this blog. It would have been almost 2 years this June, had I not broke my not-writing streak. I have been busy, &amp; life has been exceptional. So let's get started by rewinding the clock to September, 2016.</p><p>It's been going great with my Indie gig, I am selling decent units of my apps on a monthly basis, working on them, participating in hackathons, started working part-time for a startup called Pinstriped, being super busy. Around mid-September I recieve a mail from a Google recruiter about an opportunity, which I jump at. Then 8 months, 2 telephone interviews, 5 onsite interviews in-a-day at Hyderabad, and a long-wait later I recieve a confirmation in late-April about getting into Google. Joined Google on May 22, 2017, have been thoroughly enjoying it so far. Made a lot of friends. Got opportunities to visit Singapore &amp; US. Took a trip to Malaysia. It's been a blast working here.</p><p>So now we come to the point of this post. Love, &amp; how I finally confessed it to her. Its 30th March, Anurag, Aartika &amp; I are coming out of a restaurant, after celebrating Anurag's birthday. I ask if we could have ice-cream at Naturals. They agree. We reach there and find out theres a long line, so we decide to take an Uber and have it home-delivered. So while we are waiting for an Uber, I remember that a while ago while I was chatting with Aishwarya, she had challenged me to get alcohol for her when I went back home (She too stays in my hometown, Vadodara, which is in Gujarat, a dry state). Besides Naturals there's a wine-shop, I go in get a wine bottle for her, with plans to take the bottle with me to Gujarat the next day (I planned to celebrate my birthday with family, &amp; hence was leaving on March 31st morning, with plans to stay there till 4th of April), ask her out to deliver the contraband &amp; tell her about how I felt, when we were alone. I reach Vadodara, I meet her once at my Aunt's home &amp; once on my Birthday before that. She baked macarons for me on my birthday, preety sweet. The very next day, 3rd of April, I ask her out to meet at a garden to deliver the wine bottle.</p><p>It's evening of 3rd April 2018, we meet in the garden as decided. We start walking, we are talking about random stuff, she looks as beautiful as always, her smile still has the same effect. After walking for a while, she suggests we sit-down on a bench. We do. I could not hold-back myself anymore. I gather all my courage to start THE conversation &amp; I ask her 'Are you in a relationship?', &amp; I hear back a line at the exact same moment my question ends - 'I had a crush on you since seventh grade'. I take a moment to digest what I just heard, I confess that I have loved her for as long as I can remember. I have been holding this in for so long, &amp; now I feel stupid. We could have been together for the past 10 years, &amp; just because I never said anything, I wasted all this time. We talked for a while after that, telling each other how we might have missed each others signals. And sometimes how our signals cancelled each other's out. I also found out that I fucking suck at reading signals.</p><p>I never remember feeling as happy &amp; at peace in my life as I felt then. Couldn't have been happier. We went on a breakfast date the very next day as my flight got delayed by few hours. I left reluctantly for Hyderabad that afternoon. After that I went back to Vadodara this month again to spend some more time with her. No matter how much time I spend with her, it never feels enough. And now I am sitting at my desk, missing her, hoping she moves to Hyderabad very soon.</p><blockquote>If you have to ask, you’ll never know.

A lot has happened in one year. I have left my job at Perleybrook Labs as of December 2015, &amp; started my own gig as an Indie Developer since the 1st day of this year. Things have never been better.</p><p>Its 30th June, I have officially completed second quarter of my gig. I have published 3 apps to the Appstore. Falcon for MacOS, its iOS companion Falcon Notes &amp; a small app called Exporter for MacOS. In case you want to check them out they are showcased here (<a href="http://star-lord.me">http://star-lord.me</a>). In the latest WWDC Apple renamed <strong>OS X</strong> to <strong>MacOS</strong>. Funny story about Falcon. I was not sure what to name the app, so as a pun I named it Falcon, since it was my first (Han ) Solo project (I hope you are a Star Wars fan) :D. Working on your own is a thing I think everyone should try atleast once. It feels like tech era's survival edition. But, there is no greater joy than watching people use &amp; love the product you put time &amp; effort into. So its totally worth it.</p><p>In other news I got a Netflix subscription a few months ago, and I have been addicted to it ever since. I have completed around 45 seasons from various TV series till date, just from Netflix. I run Netflix videos in background while working, kind of like white noise, helps me out to work for longer intervals. Sometimes it is a big distraction though. Since I started working as an Indie, I have learned about self discipline a lot, to maintain my schedule &amp; keep up with the deadlines, so this distraction too shall pass.</p><p>Let's see what else. I have been learning a lot of new stuff - designing, marketing &amp; building web apps. I have been watching more movies with friends than before; socialising more now. I still take part in programming competitions, but the frequency is quite less. Building an actual product for real life tech market, beats competing in programming contests. Sometimes I get too bored to do any work for a couple of days, and take long breaks from coding. I guess this is a downside of being an Indie, a lone wolf. I never thought I would say this but working in a team beats being an Indie <strong>sometimes</strong>.</p><p>But I must say leaving Perleybrook Labs has been the toughest decision I ever made, &amp; took a lot of shit for it from most relatives, parents were fine with it though. Working from home with a decent pay-check is considered kind of "Living the Dream", and I agree. But the success &amp; a few failures I had building stuff back then, have never given me any rush. Building stuff was always a rush, not shipping any of it was the buzz killer. So I decided to take some risks, and start my own gig this year. And having shipped 3 products in 6 months, which are doing well, &amp; have taught me so much while designing, building &amp; marketing them, that I am positive it was the perfect decision. And yeah I also made some new techie friends while building those products, while being an introvert. How cool is that.</p><blockquote>Do what you love, love what you do.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Redemption]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Its 10:20 in the morning of a sunny day, 18 April' 15.

I am paying my last visit to my favorite Roulette Table at the casino, before I catch the 10:30 shuttle to McCarran Airport. I take out a $20 bill, give it to the dealer and ask for $1 chips. I wished to see Ann, Jose or Glen dealing at the table as I ususally saw them most of the times I played there for the last week, familiar faces. But its a new dealer, who only oblidges to let me play after she checks my ID and confirms that I am indeed legally allowed to play. I always hate when the dealers ask for an ID. Anyways I place 19 chips on number 13, put 1 chip in my coat pocket as a souvenir. I see other player smiling, some nodding in negation and pointing at the last winning numbers on the digital display. I couldn't see 13 on the board either. But it is my last bet, and it has to be 'LUCKY 13'. I think losing that chips wouldn't make any difference considering last night's winnings. One of the players bets 1 chip on top of number 13 after seeing my enthusiasm and wishes me good luck. The dealer gives the roulette wheel a spin, and drops the ball in. The ball completes two circles, and the dealer announces 'No more bets'. Andrenaline pumps in. I don't remember being this excited, EVER! (Just to give you an idea about the odds I am playing against - there are 38 numbers on the wheel, 0, 00 and 1-36. The chances of winning while betting on a single number are less than 3%.) The ball losses some momentum and is prepared to land on one of the 38 numbers on the wheel. Tock, tock, tock, tock!!! I see the ball landing momentarily on number 1, still having little momentum left, and in a split second my luck gives it a little nudge and the ball trips over to the number 13. Holy shit!!! I have never seen a dealer's jaw drop before, but I see it now. This is the second time I am hearing the phrase 'You lucky son of a gun!' in last 10 hours. The players on the right are still in awe, still going 'HOLLLYY SHIT!! How much did you win?' There is a volley of fist bumps. I cannot stop smiling, and cannot stop recalling what one of the dealers said the other night, at the very same table. "You quit while you are winning, not while you are losing". I take out my phone to calculate the winnings, I have little computational power left in my brain over all the excitment, when suddenly my sleep breaks due to some turbulence on the flight. I guess I am having a flashback dream of my last glorious victory at the roulette table. A cherry on the top of the Vegas trip which has been one hell of a dessert. So let's rewind our clocks back a month to see how I ended up at this very exact moment.</p><p>I have been working from home for past 7 months I think. Its pleasant working from home. There couldn't be a better word to describe working from home; PLEASANT! I wake up around 5:30, sleep before 1:00, work out, read, avoid junk food, work efficiently, procastinate less, often work on side-projects or some algorithm contests over weekends. Basically I have been trying to be 'Mr.Goody Two-Shoes' for the past 5 months, out of the 7 I have been home from Palakkad. And in a way it has paid off. Running in the morning really brightens up rest of the day, and as for the weekend toil, I have won my first gold in a Hackerrank contest, and almost all my graphs on Topcoder, Codechef, Codeforces and Hackerrank, are soaring higher than ever. I think it was the second week of March when through some very surprising turn of events, redemption arrived via E-mail; redemption for being 'Mr.Goody Two-Shoes', an opportunity to be bad, or dare I say at my level worst. Our tech-team at Perleybrook Labs had decided to go to Las Vegas, sin-city to attend the International Security Conference. Vegas, Baby!</p><p>We were supposed to visit Vegas for a week, Apirl 12-18. Until April 12, it was all about, finding the passport, getting the visa, packing a bag, Yes! a single backpack for a trip overseas, and completing our current project at Perleybrook Labs, to be able to present it at the conference. 12<sup>th</sup> April arrived, and I was on my way to Dubai on a morning 4:30 flight from Ahmedabad Airport. Dubai Airport was like nothing else I have ever seen before. It is overwhelmingly gigantic. In order to reach to other terminal to catch my flight to LAX, I had to travel in the biggest Elevator I have ever been in, with an artificial waterfall in the background, and a train that ran inside the Airport, a freaking train inside the Airport to go from gate-B to gate-A. And aside from that there were huge list of shops inside the airport, an unrivaled shopping experience. I managed to catch the flight to LAX in time. An 18 hour flight, most of which I spent watching the tv-series 'The Mentalist' on the monitor attached to the back of seat in front of me. It was kind of fun, in a way. I arrived at LAX, hopped on to the flight to Vegas. I slept through the whole flight, I was tired. I didn't even knew when the flight took-off or when it landed. I only remember people loading and unloading their bags from the upper carriage. The expression on the face of the passenger next to me was pretty hilarous when I asked him if we had arrived in Vegas. He must have thought I was high.</p><p>I stepped out of the Airport, to see almost all the car brands I have managed to lay my eyes on only while playing NFS, right in front of my eyes, outside the Arrival terminal. It was a sight to behold. I caught a cab and reached 'Palace Station', Hotel number 1. I was too tired, but I decided not to sleep. I roamed around and breath some casino air - a giant smoking zone with lots of light, slot machines, game tables and lots of people enjoying losing money, as much enjoyable as it could be. I incurred some losses at the three-card poker table that night, but it was fun. Next day I moved to circus-circus hotel, a hotel that was located on the strip (Area filled with Casinos and Hotels alone). This hotel seemed more fun than the last one. I walked from Palace Station to Circus-Circus in middle of the afternoon, to roam around a bit and take some snaps on the way. Had a pretty good time, bought a lot of candies, sugary delights for rest of my stay in Vegas. Roamed around in the casinos of Circus-circus, again lost some money at the three-card poker and holdem-poker tables. Poker is different here than that I used to play online. Its house vs the players rather than player vs player. Poker becomes a bit boring when you cannot bluff. Went to room, took rest for a while, waited for other two guys from our Perleybrook Labs team to arrive in Vegas. Melson arrived in the evening of 13th April. We payed the casino a visit in no time. I dicovered a new game that I have not been interested in, before I arrived at vegas - Roulette. When we joined the table, I think we were the only two players on the table. 5 minutes into the game and I was hooked, maybe because I finally started winning some chips back. I found my jam. I had a good winning streak that night for a while, I had a little audience too, watching me beat the odds. I gained some profit that evening, and again lost all of it at the same table on the same night. It was fun. I learned that I had less fun losing chips, after I had experienced winning them once.</p><p>I had some of the best times in Vegas while playing on that roulette table - Table-A, third seat from the left, blue chips. Met some interesting people from all around the world. Had some interesting conversations with the dealers. Smoked some French cigarettes, had a few beers, a hell lot of fist bumps, won and lost a lot of chips while sipping Vodka Martini, Shaken, Not Stirred. It was freaking awesome. Winning in a casino Bond style. I visited the roulette table whenever I could.</p><p>April 14-16 were mainly dedicated to ISC. I have never seen so many cool tech ideas under one roof before, and I remember there was a shiny White Dodge Charger at the expo. Couldn't forget that! In the world of tech, I saw some pretty cool stuff there. Door locking mechanism that was using a tech enabling them to jump electricity through air, without using a conductor; AI robots that could be used for surveillance, and could notify humans when they detect something out of the ordinary; social network monitoring services, spooky ones; video cameras that could track a person or group of people across the street and much more. Also learned some tricks of the trade, and a couple of things about how an access control system works (The main intention behind our trip). On the day before the last, our CTO, Rajith, took us to Caesars Palace for the 'all you can eat buffet'. I tried some non-vegetarian dishes, broke my pact with mother nature for a day. Sushis, shrimp, pork, salmon, tofu cheese, some freaking delicious desserts, and many more dishes. We also visited Bellagio in the evening for a show by the Blue Man Group. Their showmanship on stage is unparalleled. It was an altogether new experience. We also saw the Bellagio fountains dance to the tunes of 'Time to say goodbye', goosebumps all over. Meslon and I were visiting Vegas for the first time, but Ranjith had been to Vegas before. Ranjith showed us the non-gambling entertaining side of Vegas, and we returned him the favour by making him play roulette. It was fun.</p><p>On the last night in Vegas, after I came back to my room to get a good night's sleep, to be ready for flight back home the next morning, something felt missing. I was in vegas, I had won some and lost some, but my net result was still 'loss', and I still had some cash left. I decided to abandon sleep and pay a visit to the roulette table. My heart was still not content with gambling. I think I played till 4:30 in the morning, and won more than enough to bury my losses deep in ground. Visited Pizzeria at 4:30 to find it closed. It was hilarious. Sir, you are 4 hours too early. Pizzeria was the place we had our lunch and dinner most of the time, cheese Pizza and a heineken, just perfect. I slept for 3 hours, had last breakfast in Vegas with the team at the usual bagel cafe, and headed back to casino to gain one last piece of action at the roulette table, before I left Vegas. I bought 20 $1 chips from the dealer, put one in my coat pocket as souvenir and as the last bet in Vegas, I decided to bet on LUCKY 13! And the rest my friend as they say it, "is history". :)</p><blockquote>"You quit while you are winning, not while you are losing!"</blockquote>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[CodeHorizon]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>It was either 12th September late-night or 13th September early morning, I don't remember.

Most of the time I lose track of time and carry on reading or whatever I am doing till I finally feel the gravity pulling my eyelids down.</p><p>I was checking my e-mails. There were many email from Codeforces and TopCoder in there, most of them notifying about the upcoming round of algorithmic contests. I realized I had missed a lot of them lately as I hadn't been able to check the mails for a while. Being an insomniac I am always trying to make the most of my sleeplessness. I started writing blogs and weekend projects like - Code-Art, Captain-Bookmark, Jekyll Booklet and some more, thanks to lack of sleep. This time I was trying to figure out the solution to the problem 'How can I lower the frequency of missing good algorithm contests'. And so the game was on.</p><p>First thought - design a cool webApp. But again there were many Coding Calendar apps already present, and if I was just going to improve the design of the calendar, I wasn't adding any functional value to the already existing. Second thought create an iOS app. I have been doing iOS development for 3 months now, I was learning to design stuff, I had recently earned a 100$ from Topcoder's Swift Challenge (which I could invest in apple's developer program, and submit apps to appStore for an year). So it was decided, if I can design and develop an app, that I would love to look at and love to use, I would submit it to app Store as my first indie-app (I am one of those guys who likes saying 'we' but prefers 'me' a little but more). So that weekend I downloaded the 15-day trial version of 'Sketch' on my mac, and utilized all the time and brain I could use, to design an app that I would be compelled to download at first sight.</p><h2 id="collecting-the-materials">Collecting  the materials</h2><p>I had already found the tool in which I was going to design my first app - Sketch. Next I had to find a data-source which could provide the app with information about all the ongoing and upcoming contests on variety of websites. HacerRank Calendar's RSS was the perfect fit. I collected all the data-data-data I could get to get started, cause I cannot make good bricks without good clay. After a weekend filled with iterate and improve on the design, I did finalize the design, and at-least to me it looked B-E-A-utiful , good enough to get started with the coding.</p><h2 id="coding">Coding</h2><p>This is my favorite part. The next two weekends, 20-21 &amp; 27-28 September , I drowned myself in coding the app, and further improving the design, creating logo and the website. Busy-busy-busy.  The one rule I followed while coding is - "Build the app using just code". What I mean is, while using Xcode, you can develop components of the app by using drag-and-drop objects to interpret design into code without worrying what happens backstage. Something like WYSIWYG (What you see is What you get), but I have run into plenty of instances where this wasn't completely true, and hence the rule. It was really fun, translating the design into code one pixel at a time. By the end of two weekends, the app was functional. I could see the ongoing and upcoming events on the app, set notification times, see notifications pop-up on the set time. Something you created is working as it is supposed to be is the best feeling in the world there is.</p><h2 id="submitting-to-the-appstore">Submitting to the AppStore</h2><p>Submission thou art a heartless bitch. It was not easy. I submitted the first build to iTunesConnect and realized I spelled 'Upcoming' wrong - 'Upcomming', had to withdraw the submission. Next submission, I succeed in submitting, but on using testFlight Beta, I realized that as I had used Xcode 5 which did not support iOS8 SDK, the notifications did not work on my device, submission withdrawn. So I downloaded Xcode 6 Beta, uploaded the build, and received the message 'Build rejected as it was built using a beta version'. Next I try downloading Xcode 6's GM version, download fails 3 times on top of slow internet connection. Damn it! Frustration at its peak. I thought to stop for few days, let my mind cool-off and start again. After 3 days, I update iTunes and try downloading again, this time I succeed. Hurray! I built the app using Xcode 6, quickly tested the ipa file on my device, the notifications working fine this time and submitted the app to appStore on October 6, 2014. Finally the submission got accepted and then the 'Waiting for review' phase began. Mission accomplished.</p><p>But, I committed a huge mistake in the excitement of submitting the app to the app-Store, that would eventually come around and bite me in the ass. I forgot to test the app on iOS7 device, and the notifications did not work in iOS 7 devices when the app got launched. A minor set-back that I will be fixing in version 1.1. I learned a valuable lesson.</p><p>On October 16, 2014 the app was reviewed 'alright' by appStore and my first app was launched. Couldn't contain my happiness when I downloaded the app from AppStore and found it was working perfectly. But the happiness was short-lived. One of my friends installed the app, and thank God he hadn't yet updated to iOS8. He quickly informed me that the notification were crashing the app on his device. I was a bit disappointed and feeling a bit angry. I hunted the bug down, terminated it and submitted the version 1.1 of CodeHorizon to appStore. I am now waiting for CodeHorizon 1.1 to be reviewed and launched to the appStore , this time bug-free.</p><p>If you would like to checkout the app, you can do so <a href="http://star-lord.me/CodeHorizon">here</a>. This was my experience building my first app, I hope you enjoyed reading it.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>To all those who recognize this title you can go back to watching the next episode, and to all those who do not, well, you're in for an absolute treat !!!</p><p>This post is going to be about a TV-Seires named "Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey".

"Cosmos" as stated on IMDB is 'A documentary series that explores how we discovered the laws of nature and found our coordinates in space and time.', but it is much much more than that. Never before in my life have I been subjected to such an amazing show, a beyond perfect bond of Science and Imagination. The show takes us from the cosmos around us that lies within the tiny spaces of atoms to the huge observable or imaginable Universe that stretches out around us, in graphics that lets your curiosity graph break boundaries and sets your mind free on a journey of experiencing and understanding Science like never before.</p><p>The show is hosted by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> and hosted perfectly it is indeed. If you are a sort of curious-by-nature like me, you are going to love this show. Cosmos explores everything you have learned in science in a whole new way. Compressing the age of Universe into a single calendar-year, exploring the genesis of life and nature's design that is - evolution, the birth and death of stars, visualizing photosynthesis, introducing some unsung and great Scientists we ought to know about; everything in the show is explored using a virtual vehicle made up of equal parts of Science and Imagination. Its too freaking awesome, more awesome than 'Sherlock', there I said it. Maybe equally awesome, and a little bit more. In gist, you gotta see it to believe it. Luckily the show has started this year and has completed just the first season, and as of now you and I are having just few hours of backlog episodes.</p><p>I have currently finished watching first six episodes, and my favourite moments until now are - "Scaling the age of Universe to one year", "Explanation of why Speed of light is the universal speed-limit", "The Evolution Tree", "Watching stars in the sky is nothing less than Time-Travel", and the fact that "A neutrino can travel through 100 Light-years of Steel without slowing down.". I mean neutrino makes Superman look like a wuss. Anyways, watch it and thank me later.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_erVOAbz420?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><blockquote>“There are as many atoms in each molecule of your DNA as there are stars in a typical galaxy.

There is too much of Jedi wisdom in there, which I am in dire need of. I have lost my path master !!! The last few weeks, no lets say for past month, my schedule and plans have went off track. May be its the rains, or the weather, or 'The Cockroach Menace' due to onslaught of rains and my battle against them that has been a constant source of distraction. Alas, there is no Jedi way to deal with these monsoon insects, excuse for a life form, you gotta turn your dark side on and finish them all (Like General Grievous deals with the Republic clones). Too much Star Wars ? Nope, I passed that limit last week and created a new one !!!</p><p>Last month has been a blast !!! Started getting frequent meals from McDonald's, and the meals are happy indeed. Now instead of 'hello sir', I am greeted with a 'welcome back sir' there. Got tired of the fast food in home's and office's vicinty. Our team at Perleybrook Labs shipped our first product in the Mac App Store, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/statiked/id853351993?mt=12">Statiked</a>, in April and an upgrade to it last month. This month we plan to release a major update for the same, with a sleek UI, simpler UX, wordpress puller and maybe some new themes. So stay tuned ! Currently I am designing the UI/UX part, and trying to make it as Yosemitey as possible (For the non-apple-geeks, Yosemite is the new version of OS X released by Apple a few days ago). For the first time I viewed the live-stream of Apple's WWDC and the excitement and joy was way beyond expectations, limitless indeed. Apple has managed to create new standards for the beauty of Flat-UIs, and has also managed to give developers a codegasm. Codegasm ? You ask me "WHAT IS THAT ?". Its an indescribable feeling that a developer gets when he witnesses the genesis of the programming language of his dreams. A language that declares semi-colons and indentations optional and provides type inference. Ladies and Gentelmen, that beauty is named 'Swift'.</p><p>Last month, I also got to put on a different hat at our start-up. I got to be an interviewer. The role is a powerful one, and with great power comes great responsibilty. Finding a Padawan that fits all requirements of the organization is a tough task, but fortunately the search ended in a short time and we were able to make a hire. When my colleague and I went to his college at Chengannur( Its a nice place in Kerala), I also had the luck of meeting some brilliant people and made some new friends. I am impressed by the entrepreneurial culture of the students here. Many of the students here have their own start-ups, and creative minds to see their ideas through. Really inspirational stuff !</p><p>I have also been hooked on to the '2048' game for the last month, and finally reached the 'the end', hopefully, unless any of my friends beat my highscore (*Grins). Also for some short amount of time experimented with the new editor (when I say editor, I mean text-editor and not a human entity) in town, Atom. Atom is an open-source editor by Github, its preety cool, but not as cool as Sublime Text. Downloaded the XCode beta release and fiddled with playground IDE for 'Swift', amazing stuff. Let's see what else. Yeah, the code-smuggler part. I managed to smuggle some code into an Australian University. AM A BADASS CODER !!! (If you read that last line in Samuel L. Jackson voice, you are awesome.)</p><p>Finally I have also been granted permission to work from home for almost 3 months, starting from the end of July. So can't wait to get back home. I miss home in monsoons. You realize theres no place like home, when there is no hot food waiting for you when you return after taking a bath in the rains and enjoying the thunder.</p><p>Now its almost 2:30 AM in the morning here, got to get up early tomorrow. Will be closing my eyes and counting sheeps. And if that doesn't put me to sleep , after the 100th sheep every sheep gets a headshot, so PETA supporters you better start praying for my sleep. What can I do? After Hannibal's awesome season finale, theres no more bloody horror on Friday nights. So, Laters ! Until the next post then.</p><blockquote>May the force be with you !!!</blockquote>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
